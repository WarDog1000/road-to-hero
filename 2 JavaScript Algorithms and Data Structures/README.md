# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains the exercises and projects completed as part of the [FreeCodeCamp Algorithms and Data Structures course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/).

## Description

The Algorithms and Data Structures course is designed to teach the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms, as well as their implementation in JavaScript.

In this course, you will learn about the following topics:

- Basic data structures such as arrays, objects, and linked lists.
- Search and sort algorithms such as linear search, binary search, bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort.
- Advanced data structures such as binary trees, graphs, and hash tables.
- Depth-first search, breadth-first search, and graph traversal algorithms.
- Dynamic programming and recursion algorithms.

Additionally, you will learn how to apply these concepts to solve real-world programming problems and improve your algorithmic problem-solving skills.

This course is ideal for those looking to improve their programming skills in JavaScript, as well as those preparing for programming job interviews or other advanced computer science courses.
